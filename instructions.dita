For non-round ware, the brake shoe should be loosened enough so the wire-brush drive can turn the reaction wheel continually. For round ware, the brake should be tightened to prevent continual turning of the reaction wheel but adjusted to allow the reaction wheel to index approximately 1/4 to 1/2 in. [6.3 to 12.7 mm] for each container passing through the squeeze tester.<ol><li>Turn the brake adjustment knob as necessary to move the brake shoe. CAUTION: To prevent uneven wear on the reaction wheel, the brake shoe support must be vertical.</li><li>Check the brake shoe support to make sure it is vertical. As necessary, loosen the two 1/4-20 UNC socket-head brake clamp screws, slide the brake assembly mount to a position where the brake shoe support will be vertical when the brake shoe is against the reaction wheel and tighten the clamp screws. Check to make sure the brake adjustment is correct.</li></ol></li></ol><p><image alt="Diagram of a machine with text and labels  Description automatically generated" href="media/image42.png"/></p></li><li id="_Toc103751143">For Machine Adjustments of the TW0444 Guide Rails, perform the following steps:<ol><li>Adjust the conveyor infeed guide rail to allow smooth flow of containers into the squeeze tester. </li><li>Adjust the production line conveyor discharge guide rail to allow smooth flow of the containers out of the squeeze tester. Adjust the height of the rail to allow cullet and down containers to be blown off the conveyor under the guide rail.</li><li>If using the reaction wheel assembly, adjust the infeed and discharge guide rail sections.<ol><li>Loosen the 1/4-20 UNC x 1 in. hex-head bolts at the front and top of the guide rail section.</li><li>Adjust the guide rail so it just clears the reaction wheel and allows the containers to follow the same path as the production line guide rail.</li><li>Adjust the height of the infeed guide rail to provide best support for the particular container being run.</li><li>Adjust the height of the discharge guide rail to allow a down container to pass under the rail while still supporting an upright container.</li><li>Tighten all guide rail adjustment bolts</li></ol></li></ol><p><image alt="A machine with wheels and a metal frame  Description automatically generated with medium confidence" href="media/image44.png"/></p><p><image href="media/image43.png"/></p></li><li id="_Toc103751144">For Machine Adjustments of the TW0444 Speeds, perform the following steps:<p>The speed of the drive wheel (and reaction wheel, if used) must be set to maintain the speed and spacing of the ware on the conveyor. </p><note>CAUTION: Never change the speed of the Varimot mechanical drive unless the drive is running. Failure to observe this caution could damage the drive and void the warranty</note></li><li><li>Make sure the production line conveyor is running at the correct operating speed.</li><li>Turn the OFF/RUN/SETUP switch to RUN.</li><li>Press the START button on the START/STOP station. The drive wheel will extend and begin to rotate.</li><li>Adjust the speed control wheel on the Varimot drive.<li>For a wheel/shoe squeeze tester, adjust the speed control wheel until the surface speed of the drive wheel is twice the speed of the conveyor.</li><li>For a two-wheel squeeze tester, adjust the speed control wheel until the surface speed of the drive wheel matches the speed of the conveyor</li></li><p><image href="media/image45.png"/></p><note>NOTE: The speed of the upstream bottle spacer should be adjusted to run slightly above forming speeds. The single-line production conveyor should then be set to run at the speed which provides proper container spacing. Finally, the squeeze tester drive wheel should be set to maintain the container spacing in the squeezing area.==</note><note>NOTE: The drive wheel speed will require fine adjusting under production conditions to make sure the container spacing in the squeezing area is the same as the bottle spacing just prior to the squeeze tester infeed.</note></li><li><ol><li>If using the reaction wheel assembly, adjust the speed of the reaction wheel so it is the same as or slightly less than the drive wheel speed.<ol><li>Turn the Ratiotrol POWER switch to ON.</li><li>Turn the speed control potentiometer to increase or decrease the reaction wheel speed as necessary.</li></ol></li></ol><note>NOTE: When the reaction wheel speed is properly adjusted, leave the POWER switch set to ON. The DC drive motor for the wire-brush drive will start and stop with the drive wheel.</note></li><li id="_Toc103751145">For Machine Adjustments of the TW0444 Overload Assembly, perform the following steps:<ol><li>Loosen the overload-assembly mounting bracket bolts.</li><li>Adjust the forward direction of the overload assembly so the actuator will not trip the switch for a container passing properly through the squeeze tester but will trip for abnormal conditions.<p><image href="media/image46.png"/></p></li><li>Adjust the height of the overload assembly to a position suitable for the containers being run. It is usually a good idea to have the actuator low enough to detect a down container which is crosswise on the conveyor.</li><li>Adjust the position of the assembly relative to the drive wheel. It is usually best to be closer to the drive wheel for small containers and farther away for large containers.</li><li>Tighten all mounting bracket bolts.</li><li>Adjust the sensitivity of the switch for the desired actuator movement necessary for switch actuation.</li></ol><note>NOTE: The less movement it takes to make the switch actuate, the more sensitive the setting and the quicker a jam or overload will be sensed. However, if the setting is made too sensitive, false actuations can occur due to vibration or slightly misaligned containers on the conveyor.</note></li><li id="_Toc103751146">To set up the TW0444 Finish Cover Plate, perform the following steps:<ol><li>Loosen the four 5/16-18 UNC x 3/4 in. hex-head bolts securing the cover-plate mounting brackets. </li><li>Slide the cover plate over the path of the containers so it will cover the finish of the containers at all times as they pass through the squeeze tester.<p><image alt="Diagram of a metal structure with text  Description automatically generated" href="media/image47.png"/></p></li><li>Loosen the four 3/8-16 UNC x 3/4 in. hex-head bolts which secure the brackets to the mounting plates.</li><li>Adjust the height of the cover plate until the container is compressing the spring steel approximately 1/64 to 1/32 in. [0.4 to 0.8 mm] from its free position. This compression should be constant along the entire length of the cover plate.</li></ol><p><image href="media/image48.png"/></p></li><li id="_Toc103751147">To set up the TW0444 Guard Assemblies, perform the following steps:<ol><li>Close the front Lexan cover of the front guard assembly and latch in place with the cover latches on either side of the guard assembly.<p><image href="media/image49.png"/></p></li><li>Lower the back cover of the front guard assembly into its operating position.</li><li>Loosen the two wing nuts which hold the adjustable side shields and adjust the shields to the maximum closed position which will allow ware to pass without contacting the shields. Tighten the wing nuts.</li><li>Lower the drive wheel guard into position over the drive wheel assembly.</li><li>Check all rubber sheets to make sure they are present and intact. Replace any sheets which are missing or damaged.</li></ol><p><image href="media/image50.png"/></p></li><li id="_Toc103751148">To set up the Ware Transporter, perform the following steps:<ol><li>Loosen the In/Out Adjustment Lock.<ol><li>Depending on the version of the machine, it could be a handle or a cap screw as shown.</li></ol><p><image href="media/image54.png"/></p><p><image alt="A drawing of a light bulb  Description automatically generated" href="media/image53.png"/></p><p><image alt="A close-up of a machine  Description automatically generated" href="media/image52.png"/></p><p><image href="media/image51.png"/></p><note>NOTE: When the Ware Transporter is close-coupled to the Emhart High Speed Squeeze Tester, the Ware Transport Belts should be set to grip the container below the finish in a position that ensures that only good ware is grasped and transported to the discharge conveyor, while broken containers are allowed to fall to the cullet chute between containers.</note></li><li>If necessary, use the In/Out Adjustment Handles to open the belts to suit the width of the container finish.
